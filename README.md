<h1 align="center">üéπ Install Spitfire LABS with Wine on Linux</h1>

Making music on older hardware can be challenging these days‚Äîespecially with modern tools like Spitfire LABS requiring at least an Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 CPU. Personally, I liked the older versions of LABS, where it didn‚Äôt rely on WebView2 for the interface. But things change, and with Microsoft planning to end support for Windows 10, I decided to switch to Linux (Debian 13) and set up LABS using Wine.

> [!important]

> üß™ **DAW Used:** LMMS (not tested with Ardour or others)

## For Debian 13
### ‚úÖ Step 1 ‚Äì Install Wine and Dependencies

Install `wine-stable` (Wine 10.0 or similar) and required dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wine
```

#### Enable 32-bit architecture and install `wine32`:

(Some actions require root access, not just sudo)

```bash
su  # log in as root
dpkg --add-architecture i386
apt update
apt install wine32:i386
exit
```

#### Install `winbind` (required for WebView2 to avoid admin errors):

```bash
sudo apt install winbind
```

---

### Install A DAW
Make sure your DAW supports VST plugins through Wine. LMMS does.

```bash
sudo apt install lmms
```

---

### üì¶ Step 2 ‚Äì Install Winetricks, VC++ Redistributable, and .NET

Winetricks may not be included by default on some systems. You can get the official `.deb` package from [Debian Packages](https://packages.debian.org/trixie/winetricks). If there are dependency issues, run:

```bash
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

Then install Winetricks and required components:

```bash
sudo apt install winetricks
winetricks -q vcrun2015 dotnet472
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3 ‚Äì Setup WebView2 and Wine Configuration

#### Set Wine to Windows 7 mode (for WebView2 compatibility):

```bash
winecfg
# In the GUI, set Windows Version to "Windows 7", then Apply and OK.
```

#### Download and install the WebView2 Runtime:

You can get it from the [official Microsoft page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2) or use this direct installer link:
[WebView2 Evergreen Installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703)
> [!note]
> Do not use the standalone installer, cause it will install the 136.x.x version of Webview2 where it will just crash after launching LABS...

```bash
wine ~/path/to/MicrosoftEdgeWebView2Setup.exe
```

---

### üé® Step 4 ‚Äì Install Wine Graphics Packages (for rendering support)

Depending on your setup:

* **DirectX 10**:

  ```bash
  winetricks d3dx10
  ```

* **Vulkan (Recommended)**:

  ```bash
  winetricks dxvk
  ```

* **Optional**: Check your graphics capabilities:

  ```bash
  winetricks dxdiag
  ```

---

___Then, Try running LMMS and loading the LABS VST. If it opens and displays properly, you‚Äôre good to go.___

## ‚ùå If It Still Doesn't Work:

* You can try downgrading to an older version of LABS link [here](https://github.com/aKqir24/Spitfire-LABS-Installation-Guide-In-Linux/blob/main/LABS.dll.zip).
  ````bash
    # Well Your In Linux So Do This
    curl -0 https://github.com/aKqir24/Spitfire-LABS-Installation-Guide-In-Linux/raw/refs/heads/main/LABS.dll.zip
    # Or Use
    wget https://github.com/aKqir24/Spitfire-LABS-Installation-Guide-In-Linux/raw/refs/heads/main/LABS.dll.zip
  ````
* Try **Wine 9.1** or **Wine-Staging**, but be aware it may be unstable.
* Ensure your GPU drivers are working properly and that your Wine prefix is clean.

## üîÑ Notes on Arch / Artix Linux

Still working on a detailed guide for Arch-based distros. Setup is similar, but package names and version handling can differ. Stay tuned!
